# Part plans

Having a 3D model is fine but that does not give you a part to print/laser cut. So here is where this comes into play.

Depending on your setup, you might want to tweak this files a bit to export only one piece to SVG or some other format at a time.

I will try to find a better way to deal with this.
One idea for that:
